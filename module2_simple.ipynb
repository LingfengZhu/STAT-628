    "# STAT 628 Module 2 BodyFat Group 3\n",
    "#### Introduction: \n",
    "Our motivation is to obtain a precise, concise and reasonable regression model to predict body fat percentage of a male based on his body informations. Our dataset ```BodyFat``` is a real data set of 252 men with measurements of their percentage of body fat and various body circumference measurements. We assume that percentage of body fat for an individual can be estimated once body density has been determined:\n",
    "$$BodyFat(\\%) = \\frac{495}{BodyDensity(gm/cm^3)} - 450 \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "And the BMI can be calculated by:\n",
    "$$BMI = \\frac{703\\times Weight(lbs)}{Height(inches)} \\tag{2}$$\n",

    "We can first intuitively analyze the data by looking at its summary tables and histograms. There are some obvious \"abnormal\" obsevations: For example, the minimal ```BODYFAT``` is 0 %, which is unlikely to be true; besides, the maximal ```BODYFAT``` is 36 %, which is too large for a living person. We can calculate the predicted values of these \"abnormal\" data using some formula or just delete these observations.\n",

    "Calculate the rages of ```WEIGHT```,```HEIGHT```,```DENSITY```,```BODYFAT``` between there 1% quantiles and 99% quantiles respectively, any value out of such ranges can be considered as \"abnormal\" observations. We can then compare the body fat percentages calculated from formula (1) (```CalBodyFat```) and given by the dataset (```RealBodyFat```) of each observation to see if there is any strong difference. Do the same thing for BMI based on formula (2).\n",

    "**BMI:** The 42nd observation seems to be an outlier. Check his ```WEIGHT``` and ```HEIGHT``` to find out where is the problem. We can see that the *42nd* observation’s height (**29.5** inches) is out of quantile range, so we use the formula (2) to calculated the height based on his weight and BMI, it turns out that his height should be **69.43** inches. After changing the height of the *42nd* observation, we can find that the 163rd and 221st observations still don't fit the line perfectly, but after similar analysis, we find out that their heights and weights is within the quantile range above, so we won’t change them."

The *96th* obsrvation has a density far away from the density quantile range, since people can not easily obtain body density in real life, we will just remove this observation (We also drop the column ```DENSITY```). Finally, we use the 0.01 and 0.99 quantiles to replace the values out of 0.01 ~ 0.99 ranges and save the cleaned data into a ```.csv``` file.\n",

It is not difficult to find that **LASSO** and **BIC** methods give the same feature selection result. Since the CV_MSE of AIC and BIC model are close to each other, we will choose BIC model because it has less predictors."

    "*Strength*: 1. To deal with outliers, except for using the 2 formulas to correct or delete abnormal points, we also use 1% and 99% quantile of each variables to replace the value under or beyond these 2 quantiles, which is a reasonable way to reduce outliers. 2. We use Cross Validation to make our result more convincible. 3. Our two models are all linear, which are simple and with only 2 or 4 significant variables, which are all easy to measure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*Weakness*: 1. For simplicity, the number of predictor variables are not enough. 2. The method we use to deal with outliers may to some extent hide the true situation of the sample."
